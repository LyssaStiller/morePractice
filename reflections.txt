You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
    I learned the structure of an HTML doc
    I've learned some nifty things with CSS fonts and relative metrics

  * What has been easy?
  Alot of HTML is still pretty straight forward
  Getting a sense of how best to write classes and organize divs since you're going to arrange that later has been trickier, slippery
  * What has been difficult?
  watching tons of vids
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
  first project was straight forward next time I'll document this
